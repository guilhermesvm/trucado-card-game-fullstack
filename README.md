# Web and Mobile Programming

## ðŸ“– Trucado: A Full-Stack Card Game Project

This project was developed in the classroom during "Web and Mobile Programming" subject in my second year of ungraduate studies at University of Passo Fundo.

Trucado is a digital version of the popular Latin American card game "Truco," widely enjoyed in countries like Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina. It was developed using the PERN stack:

- PostgreSQL: For managing the relational database.
- Express.js: A flexible backend framework for building RESTful APIs
- React: The web application frontend, providing dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- React Native: For the mobile application.
- Node.js/TypeScript: For backend services and overall server logic.

## Backend (API)

The backend is built with Express.js and serves as the core of the application, handling:

- User Management: Authentication, authorization, friend list, game status, ranking by season
- Tournaments;
- Matches;
- Teams;
